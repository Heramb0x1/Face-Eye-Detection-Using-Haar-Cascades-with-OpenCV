# Face-Eye-Detection-Using-Haar-Cascades-with-OpenCV
I Analyzed, Trained &amp; Created a Model which detects Face &amp; Eyes from the feeded image.
<n/> Try Code Only over Jupyter NoteBook!
Currently It can only be used for images containing a single face.. A Simple One..
If It's Not Showing the rectangles around eyes and faces in the image, do try to incraese the threshold value or the number of nearest neighbours in the code
More Progressing and future updates will be done on the code! .. 😅🧑‍🔧
